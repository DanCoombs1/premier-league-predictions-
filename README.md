 # Premier League Match Predictor

This Python project scrapes football match data from the Premier League season statistics website and builds a predictive model to forecast match outcomes. The predictor utilizes machine learning techniques, particularly a Random Forest Classifier, to analyze various team performance metrics and predict the results of future matches.

## Installation

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or later).
3. Run the main Python script random_forest_epl.py.

## Usage

After installing the dependencies, run the EPL_scraping.py and the random_forest_epl.py scripts. This script scrapes data from the Premier League season statistics website, preprocesses the data, builds a machine learning model, and predicts match outcomes for future games. The predicted results are saved in a CSV file named League_table2223.csv.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following Python libraries:
- requests
- BeautifulSoup (bs4)
- pandas
- scikit-learn

These dependencies can be installed using pip, as mentioned in the Installation section.

## Data Sources

The data for this project is scraped from the [Football Reference](https://fbref.com) website, specifically from the Premier League season statistics pages. The project collects data on team performance metrics such as goals scored, goals conceded, shooting accuracy, passing accuracy, and more.

## Project Structure

- EPL_scraping.py: Python script that illustrates the scraping and preprocessing of the data
- random_forest_epl: Main Python script that orchestrates the modeling and prediction processes.
- README.md: This README file providing an overview of the project.
- League_table2223.csv: CSV file containing the predicted match outcomes and end-of-season standings for the Premier League season.
- season1823.csv: CSV file containing the scraped match data for the 2022-2023 Premier League season.

## Future Improvements

- Implement more sophisticated machine learning models for better prediction accuracy.
- Include additional features or metrics to enhance the predictive capabilities of the model.
- Predict future matches from seasons that have not yet taken place
- Predict alternate competitions such as the Champions League and FA Cup
